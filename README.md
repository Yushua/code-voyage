# code-voyage
 a ship needs to get home or something else

using the relationship model from the previous code.

you are now on a ship

you have three things

a map: this map displays every planet. this can be done crudely. I thing. lets use a screen and that there is a character on each block

travel: you can travel between each planet

during these travels things can happen. these events can be based on
- the map itself
- map updates one get from other planets.
- info from templates (books) found
- people on your ship

may be complicated, but when going from plannet to plabet, you get the information you gathered.
you can go through this information and see if its good. or, because this is in real time, go and then maybe find out there is a backhole
your choice

choices are important. each planet has a resource. you an gather it, although there are choices.
- is the planet inhabited
- do you have permission
- do you have the tools

to play it safely. tools can be created, but they take time (no resources needed to make them)
if inhabited, you have a diplomacy. it needs to fill up. success gives you exp, not successful lowers your chances
if its full, congrats, you get the stuff. if not, war (war needs to be implimented)
there is also the choice of giving them something, this again, can take time.

planets are usefull, they give you
- resources
- people
- information

there are passengers on your ship: 

user
- name
- last name
- rank
- health
- stamina
- place of origin
- space needed
- birthday
- combat style
- speed
- happiness
- hunger
- location
- location bed

the ship: the ship has certain compartments. each day a person goes to
- a compartment based on their proffesion
- they have a room to sleep
- the captain is always on the bridge
- the chief engineer in engineering
- scientist can either be experimenting, on the bridge
- other compartments can be designated. based on the people you have on the bridge

- now. the only thing now is to have them move. each day they move from bed -> breakfast -> work -> lunch -> work -> dinner -> bed

things to add

- cycles. not everyone works. so there is a 12 hour shift. but not every proffession needs it
- captain
- engineer
- cook

thats it.

proffesion:
there is also a
- captain
- cook
- chief engineer
- chief scientist

so those beds are there.

then a random assortment of people. each giving you a plus and a minus to the chip itself. you need to work with what you have.

with resources gathered you can expand the bridge and then on planets give them in.

there are three types of rooms

- sleep
- function
- entertainment (eating)

while entertainments can be increased (so much space per person. if its lower, they get unhappy)
sleep for each perosn and their needs
function, their proffession requires X space

year only has 365 days;

Rooms:

thye are important. they have a limit. so many people. and a person has needs.

a ship can have more crew and more space. this is not a real thing so rooms can be added to the ship with resources. once the moving is done


so for the next phace this needs to happen.

1. rooms need to have the minimum need given
2. rooms have statuses. besides sleeping quarters. they need to be of use
3. rooms with use give buffs. so during situations those buffs are all included
4. assign crew to a room
5. see all the rooms
6. see all the crew

when assigning. a system in place to place the crew there and see the buffs

the next phace, planets.

this is easy, one needs to create a grid of maybe 10000 by 10000. on this
there are systems. in this phave there is nothing but a random amount of planets with only names

the thing is, to fly to such a system. this means an action

1. one can see all the systems
2. each system shows three things "resources, habitable, name"
3. create the planets for each system
4. set the location for each system
5. set the location for each planet in the system

the next phace

have the optin like assigning the crew. to set course towards a planet
1. have a screen that shows the system information. so how many planets, the names. habitable, etc
2. then one can choose the planet. this is not important. one does not need to choose
3. once confirmed. one sees the time like usual and the distance still needed to travel and how long it takes.

next phace fuel
each ship has fuel. its stored. this is a bit of math, but one needs to have enough fuel.
when creating a ship, the amount of fuel in finite. meaning just that max. the point is to use it well.
the ship has several speeds.
1. that uses no fuel, slow
2. medium speed, low fuel cost. normal
3. high speed. high use. but quicker there

when planning a planet.
1. it tells you how much fuel it will cost for each one.
2. how long it will take

for now its alright if one cannot reach a planet, just that the info is correct. one always starts at a planet that has
some resources to take hold off. the point is the information on the screen. we go from a simple temrinal based
maybe now to a more updated phace. still the information. but better.

later phaces
- gathering resources
- using resources
- gathering new crew
- sending away crew on missions
- events while traveling
- ships health
- repairing
- upgrades
- training

on missions. one can send someone out. there can be two types
1. the ship is send away and the ship waits.
2. the ship is send away as is the mission ship. they return when back.
the second one is trickerier. one can think the mission is successful and reutnr. but if it fails
then the ship can send out a distress. if chances are correct. the ship either gets it or not.

ships health: this is tricky. the important part is, is that there are two healths. the cmpartments. so the rooms. and the hull.
right now I have the rooms. not the hull. so there needs to be a calucaltion or even a creation where they are.
also a shield for the ship.

however this is not important for now. its diplomacy and flying and gathering enough resources. how far do you want to go
how long do you want to stay? you are not forced to move and go. you can stay gather, upgrade.

crewmembers can get training during travels. this si where the job time is in. during their free time. they have the option
to have some free time, or be assigned training. this gives exp to increase that proffessions skill. if hit. they can do a test
if successfull, they get that proffession. doing work on that proffesion also gives exp. training is important if you want
to be a captain. one needs all the proffessons.

if enough is met. one can do a captains training. if successfull, hey can take over as captain if the captain dies.
