so text, how should thigns go

when the game is fully made, text should be made. for example. different foods the ship has.

this can be one or two ways, one. meals are made. or meal options. each mean has so many resources so only so many can be made.
when someone eats, the message "they consume this meal" cna be made.

on certain days certain meals cna be provided.

this can be fun to make and should not be too hard to impliment, but to create it is another matter. each resource cna be a calory intake. a ship only haso so much calory.

on each day a report can be seen, showing how much people sleep on average, work and free time. it should also tell you how much they eaten and how much the supply will last.
